# Excel-Project-1 On Store Annual Report
This is my 2nd Git Project
In this Project I Create an annual sales report, so that the store
understands its customers and will increase sales next year.

Generated annual sales reports to provide in-depth customer insights, enabling strategic decision-making. Utilized data analysis to understand customer behaviors and market trends, facilitating targeted strategies for sales growth. Demonstrated commitment to optimizing business performance and enhancing customer satisfaction.

● Firstly Insert slicers of Month, Category and Channel. With the help of Month slicer we can easily see which
month customers like to shop most. In category slicer we can easily find which type of category has the most
profit.In channel slicer we analyze which channel is most used by customers and most selling rate.

● Created charts of Order vs sale (In which month how much orders have), Sales:Men vs Women ( who does
the most shopping). Order Status ( How much has been Orders are canceled, Delivered, Returned, Refund ).
Sales:Top 5 State ( Which State has ordered Most ).Age vs Gender ( Which Group Orders most ).
Order: Channels ( Which channel used most by customers )

● Write insight on all the created charts and finally give the conclusion , how can store increase their sales
with help of extra off and coupons to attract customers to more orders.
